## About
I am an Android developer with 6+ years of commercial experience in outsourcing, start-ups, and fintech. I’ve worked in teams from 1 to 30 members, both remotely and on-site. With 3+ years as a tech lead, I’ve managed the full development cycle, from requirements gathering to automated releases with high test coverage, analytics, documentation, and CI/CD. I also have hands-on experience with POS/EMV systems and have solid experience with Kotlin Multiplatform using Compose Multiplatform.

In addition to Android, I’ve built fintech features on the backend (2+ years), led an ML-based face recognition project still in use at my university.
