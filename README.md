## üìå About
I am an Android developer with over 7+ years of commercial experience across outsourcing, startups, and fintech companies. I have worked in teams of varying sizes, from solo development to 30-member teams, both remotely and on-site.

With over 3 years as a tech lead, I have managed the full development cycle, from gathering product owner requirements to implementing a fully automated release process with high test coverage, analytics, and CI/CD. I am passionate about researching and integrating new technologies.

Additionally, I have experience with backend development (2+ years), particularly in fintech projects. My background also includes ML/AI, as I led a face recognition project for my university diploma, which remains in use today.
